My name is Zynh Ludwig. I do lots of stuff generally revolving around computers, from programming to gaming. I currently live near McMinnville, Oregon and am studying at HackReactor. This blog is a place for me to put useful things for use later, problems I've encountered and how I solved them, or just anything I feel like talking about.
